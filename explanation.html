        <h1 class="headingtext">So... how does it work?</h1>
        <p class="technicaltext">Each round, the player plays a random map and must pick 2 cards that add difficulty modifiers or self-imposed challenges. These modifiers will create a custom difficulty just for this run (as of Phasmophobia's v.0.7 "Apocalypse" update), which starts as Professional difficulty and gets harder as the run goes on.<br><br>The last card offered will always be a mystery, and all maps are small except during the 3rd and 5th round.<br><br>Failing to beat a map or to complete a challenge will fail the run.</p>
