        <p class="technicaltext">Every round, the player plays a random small map and chooses 2 cards that may add difficulty modifiers. These modifiers will create a custom difficulty just for this run (as of Phasmophobia's v.0.8 "Apocalypse" update), which starts as Professional difficulty and gets harder as the run goes on.<br><br>Every 3rd round, the player chooses 1 self-imposed challenge and plays a bigger map. Failing to beat a map or to complete a challenge, will fail the run.<br><br>Most cards may only be chosen once per run.</p>
